siriproxy-picturejokes
======================

About
-----
Siriproxy-picturejokes is a [SiriProxy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) plugin that allows you to push custom pictures and text to Apple's Siri interface on any iOS device that supports Siri.   It does not require a jailbreak, nor do I endorse doing so.

First, you must have SiriProxy installed and working.  

Second, you need to have access to or set up a web server on your SiriProxy server to host the custom pictures you want to push to Siri.  Simply type `apt-get install apache2 -y`.   The default configuration for APACHE will work.   Your pictures need to reside in the `/var/www/` folder.  

Third, if you VPN into your home network and configure your iOS device to route all traffic through the VPN connection you can get lots of laughs at your local pub.  See the Wiki page for links to how I set up a VPN using my home router. 

Here is a short demonstration video: Coming soon...   


Pictures
-----------------
- Pictures at least 640 pixels in width will be centered on the screen.  iOS will resize wider pictures to fit.  
- Pictures with 2x3 portrait aspect ratio fill the screen, leaving just enough room for the Siri bar.  
- iOS seems to support multiple picture formats.  I have used JPG, JPEG, and PNG files.  Not sure about other formats.  
- Pictures are antimated differently depending on picture format.  Example: PNG files rotate in.   JPG files will scroll in.  I haven't compared other picture formats.
- Pictures used in this example are intentionally not provided. Refrain from using copyprotected photos.
